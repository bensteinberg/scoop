## About

**Scoop** is a high fidelity, browser-based, web archiving capture engine from the [Harvard Library Innovation Lab](https://lil.law.harvard.edu). 

Fine-tune this custom web capture software to create robust single-page captures of the internet with accurate and complete **provenance information**. 

With extensive options for asset formats and inclusions, Scoop will create **.warc**, **warc.gz** or **.wacz** files to be stored by users and replayed using the web archive replay software of their choosing.

Scoop also comes with built-in support for the [WACZ Signing and Verification specification](https://specs.webrecorder.net/wacz-auth/0.1.0/), 
allowing users to cryptographically sign their captures.

## Using Scoop as a CLI command

Here are a few examples of how the `scoop` command can be used to make a customized capture of a web page.

```bash
# This will capture a given url using the default settings.
scoop "https://lil.law.harvard.edu" 

# Unless specified otherwise, scoop will save the output of the capture as "./archive.wacz".
# We can change this with the `--output` / `-o` option
scoop "https://lil.law.harvard.edu" -o my-collection/lil.wacz

# But what if I want to change the output format itself?
scoop "https://lil.law.harvard.edu" -f warc -o my-collection/lil.warc

# Although it comes with "good defaults", scoop is highly-configurable ...
scoop "https://lil.law.harvard.edu" --capture-video-as-attachment false --screenshot false --capture-window-x 320 --capture-window-y 480 --capture-timeout 30000 --max-capture-size 100000 --signing-url "https://example.com/sign"

# ... use --help to list out all the available options, and see what the default are.
scoop --help
```

## Using Scoop as a JavaScript library

**Scoop** can be used as a library in a Node.js project. 
Here are a few examples of how to programmatically capture web pages using the `Scoop.capture()` method, which returns [an instance of the `Scoop` class](https://github.com/harvard-lil/scoop/blob/main/Scoop.js). 

```javascript
const capture = await Scoop.capture(url, options)
```

### Quick access
- [List of available options for `Scoop.capture()`](https://github.com/harvard-lil/scoop/blob/main/options.types.js)
- [`Scoop.toWACZ()` method](https://github.com/harvard-lil/scoop/blob/main/Scoop.js#L1138)
- [`Scoop.toWARC()` method](https://github.com/harvard-lil/scoop/blob/main/Scoop.js#L1126)
- [`Scoop.fromWACZ()` method (experimental)](https://github.com/harvard-lil/scoop/blob/main/Scoop.js#L1117)


### Example: Capture with default settings
```javascript
import fs from 'fs/promises'
import { Scoop } from '@harvard-lil/scoop'

try {
  const capture = await Scoop.capture('https://lil.law.harvard.edu')
  const wacz = await capture.toWACZ()
  await fs.writeFile('archive.wacz', Buffer.from(wacz))
} catch(err) {
  // ...
}
```

### Example: Capture with custom settings
```javascript
import fs from 'fs/promises'
import { Scoop } from '@harvard-lil/scoop'

try {
  const capture = await Scoop.capture('https://lil.law.harvard.edu', {
    screenshot: true,
    pdfSnapshot: true,
    captureVideoAsAttachment: false,
    captureTimeout: 120 * 1000,
    loadTimeout: 60 * 1000,
    captureWindowX: 320,
    captureWindowY: 480
  })

  const warc = await capture.toWARC()
  await fs.writeFile('archive.warc', Buffer.from(warc))
} catch(err) {
  // ...
}
```

### Example: Working with a copy of default settings
```javascript
import { Scoop } from '@harvard-lil/scoop'

try {
  // "options" will be a copy of Scoop's default settings
  const options = Scoop.defaults

  // It therefore becomes easier to inspect said defaults ...
  console.log(options)

  // ... and edit existing values
  options.pdfSnapshot = true
  options.blocklist.push('/https?:\/\/foo/')

  const capture = Scoop.capture('https://lil.law.harvard.edu', options)

  // ...
} catch(err) {
  // ...
}
```

### Example: Using a signing server
```javascript
import fs from 'fs/promises'
import { Scoop } from '@harvard-lil/scoop'

try {
  const capture = await Scoop.capture('https://lil.law.harvard.edu')

  const signedWacz = await capture.toWACZ(true, {
    url: 'https://example.com/sign',
    token: 'some-very-secret-token'
  })

  await fs.writeFile('archive.wacz', Buffer.from(signedWacz))
} catch(err) {
  // ...
}
```

## FAQ

> üöß Under construction

### What does "browser-based" capture mean? Is it using _my_ browser?

Browser-based capture means that Scoop uses a browser - [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home/) - to visit the web page to capture and collect resources. 

Specifically, it uses an HTTP proxy to _"intercept"_ network exchanges as early as possible and preserve them _"as is"_.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Scoop]
    B[Playwright]
    C[Chromium]
    D[Website]
    E[HTTP Proxy]
    A <--> |Controls| B
    B <--> C
    C <--> D
    A <-.-> |Capture| E <-.-> C
```

The browser Scoop controls was installed specifically for programmatic access by [Playwright](https://playwright.dev), the underlying tool it uses to communicate with it, and is different from the default browser of the machine Scoop is running on. 
Additionally, Scoop creates a single-use, isolated browsing context for every capture it makes.

**More info:**
- https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers
- https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsercontext

### Does Scoop capture _everything_ through a browser?

Yes, and unless specified otherwise.

Namely:
- If the main URL to capture is _not_ a web page _(for example: a PDF file)_, it will be captured using [curl](https://curl.se/).
- Videos captured as attachments are captured outside of the browser using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).
- Favicons may be captured out-of-band using [curl](https://curl.se/), if not intercepted during capture.

Exchanges captured in that context still go through Scoop's HTTP proxy.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Scoop]
    B[curl]
    C[Resource]
    D[HTTP Proxy]
    A <--> |Controls| B
    B <--> C
    A <-.-> |Capture| D <-.-> B

```

### What is "WACZ with RAW exchanges"?

The `includeRaw` option of `Scoop.toWACZ()` allows for adding a folder named _"raw"_ in the WACZ file, which contains a copy of unprocessed HTTP exchanges coming directly from Scoop's HTTP proxy.

This feature may be used to preserve elements that would otherwise be lost, such as ill-formed HTTP headers, and could be relevant in certain contexts, such as forensic analysis.

In order to prevent unnecessary storage use, Scoop only keeps in "raw" the contents of exchange it assessed required alterations to be stored in WARCs.

**Experimental:** WACZ files stored with the `includeRaw` option can be ingested by Scoop for analysis and processing via the `Scoop.fromWACZ()` method.

## Development

### Standard JS
This codebase uses the [Standard JS](https://standardjs.com/) coding style. 
- `npm run lint` can be used to check formatting.
- `npm run lint-autofix` can be used to check formatting _and_ automatically edit files accordingly when possible.
- Most IDEs can be configured to automatically check and enforce this coding style.

### JSDoc
[JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) is used for both documentation and loose type checking purposes on this project.

### Testing
This project uses [Node.js' built-in test runner](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html).

```bash
npm run test
```

#### Tests-specific environment variables
The following environment variables allow for testing features requiring access to a third-party server. 

These are optional, and can be added to a local `.env` file which will be automatically interpreted by the test runner. 

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `TEST_WACZ_SIGNING_URL` | URL of an [authsign-compatible endpoint](https://github.com/webrecorder/authsign) for signing WACZ files.<br>To run such an endpoint locally, use `npm run dev-signer`, which will overwrite `.env` and set this variable to `http://localhost:5000/sign`; see [.services/signer](.services/signer).|
| `TEST_WACZ_SIGNING_TOKEN` | If required by the server at `TEST_WACZ_SIGNING_URL`, an authentication token. |

### Available CLI

```bash
# Runs test suite
npm run test

# Runs linter
npm run lint

# Runs linter and attempts to automatically fix issues
npm run lint-autofix

# Runs a local instance of wacz-signer for test purposes (see "Testing" section)
npm run dev-signer
```
